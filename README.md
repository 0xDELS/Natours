# Natours
Example of what could be a website for a hiking / trail business.

## Description
This is a dummy project with the intent to improve my knowlegde with CSS Animations and Design Patterns.
The BEM (Block Element Modifier) Methodology was used in order to maintain a great modularity and reusability in the HTML.
It was also implemented the 7-1 Pattern in the Sass (SCSS) files.
